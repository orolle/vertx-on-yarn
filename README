PoC: Vertx on Hadoop YARN

Proofs that vertx is executable on hadoop yarn. 

Vertx cluster is managed by hadoop yarn, 
vertx is able to execute polyglot verticles (java script, etc.), 
crashub SSH manages vertx platform instance per vertx platform instance

Setup:
* Download Hadoop distribution VM image CDH 5.2.x from cloudera: http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/downloads/quickstart_vms/cdh-5-2-x.html
* Execute VM image
* clone this project into the VM to the folder /home/cloudera/workspace
* switch to the project folder and execute mvn eclipse:eclipse
* execute eclipse and add the project to your workspace (if not alread happend)
* setup vertx on yarn is complete

Execute:
* your VM needs internet access to deploy crashub module!
* execute main() in VertxTwillContainer.java from within eclipse which does the deployment on YARN. 
* deployment of vertx on yarn takes some time: catch a coffee or pizza
* see in console if "SSH on instance" and "Java script on instance" is printed
* check	with "netstat -tlpen |  grep :31" if crashub SSH has been started: port 31999 and less.
* connect with "ssh -p 31999 admin@127.0.0.1" on crashub on the first vertx platform instance. password is admin
* another vertx platform instance is on port 31998. Use crashub to send messages between the 2 platform instances!
* q.e.d.

Clean up after execution:
* stop the execution in eclipse WILL NOT stop the execution of vertx on the cluster
* use browser on VM to navigate to http://quickstart.cloudera:8088/cluster/
* lists all running, stopped and killed YARN applications
* look for applications which are RUNNING
* copy a RUNNING application id of format application_<APPID>_<RUNID> with name Vertx and type YARN
* open a shell and insert your copied application id "yarn application -kill <application id>"
* now check with "netstat -tlpen |  grep :31" if crashub SSH ports are not listed anymore.
* no ports open means vertx has been shut down successfully

FAQ:
* vertx on yarn may fail if ports 31999 and less are already used (by previous vertx on yarn instances)
* vertx on yarn may loops till ressources are available. This happends if hadoop yarn cannot allocate ressources for its container. Check if ressources are available (RAM). You may kill other yarn applications to free ressources.
